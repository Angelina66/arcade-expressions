# Sample data expressions

This folder contains sample [data expressions](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/dashboards/get-started/create-data-expressions.htm) and recommended charts. Dashboard authors can create data expressions using the [Arcade function library](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/function-reference/) to unlock insights and create robust visualizations. Data expressions are authored, saved, and executed within the context of a Dashboard. They must return [feature sets](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/guide/types/) which can drive data driven elements in Dashboards. 

Note: Data expressions and advanced formatting in Dashboards are separate [Arcade profiles](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/guide/profiles/).
