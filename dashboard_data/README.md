# db-data-expressions

ArcGIS Dashboards will support Arcade data expressions in the coming release. Publishers can create data expressions using the [Arcade function library](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/function-reference/) to unlock insights and create robust visualizations conveniently. Data expressions must return [feature sets](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/guide/types/) which can drive data driven elements in Dashboards. Data expressions are authored, saved, and executed within the context of a Dashboard. 

This repo holds sample Arcade data expressions, along with use cases and charts. Each markdown file has a code block with a data expression. The markdown file name contains the recommended element for that data expression in curly braces.
