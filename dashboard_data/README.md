# Sample data expressions

Dashboard authors can create [data expressions](https://docdev.arcgis.com/en/dashboards/get-started/create-data-expressions.htm) using the [Arcade function library](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/function-reference/) to unlock insights and create robust visualizations. Data expressions must return [feature sets](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/guide/types/) which can drive data driven elements in Dashboards. Data expressions are authored, saved, and executed within the context of a Dashboard. 

This folder holds sample data expressions and recommended charts. 

Note: Data expressions and advanced formatting in Dashboards are separate [Arcade profiles](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/guide/profiles/).
