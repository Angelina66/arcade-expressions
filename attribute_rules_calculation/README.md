# Attribute Rule Calculation expressions

This folder contains Attribute Rule expression templates and functions that may be used in the [alculation-attribute-rules profile](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/geodatabases/overview/calculation-attribute-rules.htm).

## General workflow

Each expression lives in a Markdown file, which contains a general description of the expression, its use case, a depiction of the result, the code to copy, and an example of an executable form of the expression along with its output. It may also include a link to a web map demonstrating the expression in action.

> Note that expressions living in this folder don't have to be exclusively used in the calculation profile. They can likely be used in different profiles, though they were originally designed for the calculation profile.

See the list below for shared expressions.
